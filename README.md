# 🔐 Make IT Private – Secure File Encryption in the Browser  
📍 [Live Preview](https://aadityansha06.github.io/make-private/)

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

MakePrivate is a **client-side encryption/decryption tool** that allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files like text, images, and videos right in the browser. It uses **AES-GCM** encryption, with the password entered by the user serving as the secret key for both encryption and decryption.

## 🛡️ Key Features

- 🔒 **AES-GCM encryption** using the user’s password as the secret key  
- 🧠 **Fully client-side**: No data is uploaded to any server  
- 🖼 **Preview functionality**: Users can preview the encrypted/decrypted files  
- 🌓 **Dark-mode UI** with drag-and-drop support for files  
- 📁 Compatible with: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.mp4`, `.txt`, `.json`, and more  
- ✅ Manual text input for file encryption and decryption

## ⚠️ Privacy First

> Your data stays private. Everything happens locally, on your device.  
> Once you encrypt a file, only you can decrypt it using your password.  
> **Important**: If you forget your password, your data is lost forever.

## 🧠 Architecture & Approach

- **Design & Conceptualization**: I provided the **core logic** of the system. For example, I decided that the password should be used as the secret key for encryption and decryption, ensuring that users have full control over their data.  
- **AI Collaboration**: I worked closely with AI tools (like ChatGPT and Claude) to transform the conceptual logic into a functional **client-side encryption** system using **AES-GCM**. The AI helped me generate the working code based on my inputs.  
- **Implementation**: The encryption/decryption is handled using the **Web Crypto API**, and the project runs entirely in the browser, ensuring that no data is transmitted to a server.

## 🧑‍💻 My Role

- 🧠 **Defined the project architecture** and provided the conceptual encryption logic (such as using the password as the encryption key)  
- ✍️ **Worked with AI** to turn the conceptual design into working code, focusing on encryption, file handling, and UI design  
- 🎨 Designed the **UI/UX**: Created a dark mode interface, file previews, and smooth drag-and-drop functionality  
- 🛠️ **Final Implementation**: Polished the code, handled bug fixes, and ensured smooth user interaction  
- 🚀 Deployed the project and made optimizations based on user feedback

> I took a **hands-on approach** to both the creative and technical aspects of the project, using AI as a tool to speed up the development process, while ensuring that my original logic and design vision were executed.

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript  
- **Encryption**: Web Crypto API (PBKDF2, AES-GCM)  
- **No Backend**: All operations happen locally, on the client side
